when player falls off the edge, it launches them forward

playerMovement: accelarate until reached set velocity, then maybe accelerate at a very slow rate (maybe even cap)

sometimes after a while all obstacles are gone (maybe not anymore with fixed speed)

Add score counter; write it out
Add slow acceleration that caps
After end, add force until y<(1 or 0)
